# Calculator
Calculator programme for school children 
This software will eventually be used by primary school children (aged 4-11) to help them accurately learn their basic arithmetic skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). 
It will also be a way for you to showcase your abilities to your new company and give them confidence in your ability to conduct all aspects of software development! 
You will have free reign to decide how the software will be designed and implemented, but it is suggested that the software is coded in a popular programming language.
